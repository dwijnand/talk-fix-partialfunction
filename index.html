# Definitions

Let's start with `Function1`.  How is `Function1` defined?

```scala
trait Function1[-A, +B] {
  def apply(a: A): B
}
```

--

But it's more commonly known by its infix type alias:

```scala
type A => B = Function1[A, B] // =>[A, B]
```

--

Which, by the way, is special because it's right-associative:

```scala
A => B => C
// means
A => (B => C)
```

---

# Definitions

And what is the definition of `PartialFunction`?

```scala
trait PartialFunction[-A, +B] extends (A => B) {
  def isDefinedAt(a: A): Boolean
}
```

--

I often type alias it.  Ideally I'd like:

```scala
type A ?=> B = PartialFunction[A, B]
```

--

(in the past I've also used this alternative:)

```scala
type A =?> B = PartialFunction[A, B]
```

--

But to make it right-associative, like `=>`, I'll use:

```scala
type A ?=>: B = PartialFunction[A, B]
```

---

# Definitions

`Function1` then has some utility methods (combinators):

```scala
trait Function1[-A, +B] {
  def andThen[C](g: B => C): A => C = a => g(apply(a))
  def compose[R](g: R => A): R => B = r => apply(g(r))
}
```

---

# Definitions

... and `PartialFunction` has a lot more methods:

```scala
trait PartialFunction[-A, +B] extends (A => B) {  
  def andThen[C](g: B  =>  C): A ?=>: C
  def andThen[C](g: B ?=>: C): A ?=>: C
  def compose[R](g: R ?=>: A): R ?=>: B
  def orElse[A1 <: A, B1 >: B](g: A1 ?=>: B1): A1 ?=>: B1

  def lift: A => Option[B] // and `.unlift` to go back
  def unapply(a: A): Option[B] = lift(a)
  def elementWise = new ElementWiseExtractor(this)

  def applyOrElse[A1 <: A, B1 >: B](a: A1, default: A1 => B1) = {
    if (isDefinedAt(a)) apply(a) else default(a)
  }

  def runWith[U](action: B => U): A => Boolean = {
    (a: A) => {
      val b: B = applyOrElse(a, checkFallback[B])
      if (!fallbackOccurred(b)) {
        action(b)
        true
      } else false
    }
  }
}
```

---

# Definitions

There are also utility methods on `PartialFunction`'s companion object:

```scala
object PartialFunction {
  def empty[A, B]: A ?=>: B

  def fromFunction[A, B](f: A => B): A ?=>: B = { case a => f(a) }

  def cond[A](a: A)(pf: A ?=>: Boolean): Boolean    = pf.applyOrElse(a, constFalse)
  def condOpt[A, B](a: A)(pf: A ?=>: B]): Option[B] = pf.lift(a)

  private val fallback_fn: Any => Any            = _ => fallback_fn
  private def checkFallback[B]: Any => B         = fallback_fn.asInstanceOf[Any => B]
  private def fallbackOccurred[B](b: B): Boolean = fallback_fn.eq(b.asInstanceOf[AnyRef])
}
```

---

# Usage

So when do you want to use `PartialFunction`?

--

1) When you want to:
  * operate on only part of the input
  * without addition runtime costs (`Option` boxing).

--

For example, mapping on only part of the elements:

```scala
xs.collect { case s if s.startsWith("FOO_") => ... }
```

--

or handling only part of the actor messages:

```scala
def receive = {
  case Deposit(amt)  => ???
  case Withdraw(amt) => ???
  // missing: CheckBalance
}
```

---

# Usage

2) When you want to define individual partial functions and then combine them with `orElse`:

```scala
myFuture.recoverWith(
  onNoUser.orElse(onNoToken).orElse(recordIncident)
)
```

---

# Implementation

So given an expression like:

```scala
param => selector match { cases }
```

what's the resulting `PartialFunction`?

--

```scala
... extends AbstractPartialFunction[..., ...] {
  // actually defined in AbstractPartialFunction
  def apply(x: A): B = applyOrElse(x, PartialFunction.empty)

  def isDefinedAt(a: A): Boolean =
    $selector match { $casesTrue; case _ => false }

  def applyOrElse[A1 <: A, B1 >: B](a: A1, default: A1 => B1) =
    $selector match { $cases; case _ => default(x) }
}
```

---

# Problem

So what problem does `PartialFunction` have?

--

```scala
trait Function1[-A, +B] {
  def apply(a: A): B
}

trait PartialFunction[-A, +B] extends (A => B) {
  def isDefinedAt(a: A): Boolean
  def apply(a: A): B
}
```

--

`PartialFunction` _changes the expectations of `apply`_

--

I believe `PartialFunction` breaks Liskov Substitution Principle.

???

The counter is from an object-oriented point-of-view

`PartialFunction` adds `isDefinedAt`

And therefore it makes sense that `PartialFunction` extends `Function1`

(Perhaps rename it `QueryableFunction`)

Now, there are no totality guarantees in Scala

There's no guarantee that `Function1` doesn't throw

But there is an _assumption_ that a `A => B` is total

Or at least defined for "most" values

`PartialFunction`'s addition of `isDefinedAt`

along with the ergonomic syntax for defining them

changes the expectations of `apply`

Suddenly it's _more likely_ that `apply` isn't defined

---

# Problem

Here's an example of such an expectation:

```scala
scala> List("FOO_A", "BAR_B").map {
     |   case s if s.startsWith("FOO_") => s
     | }
scala.MatchError: BAR_B (of class java.lang.String)
  at .$anonfun$res0$1(<console>:1)
  at scala.collection.immutable.List.map(List.scala:226)
  ... 58 elided
```

---

# Problem

To put it another way:

Given a value of type `Function1[..., ...]`

* Is calling `apply` safe?
* Should I check `isInstanceOf[PartialFunction[_, _]]`?
* Should I just `try`/`catch` it?

---

# Problem

There's one additional (much smaller) problem:

--

```scala
scala> Try[Int](???).recover(_ => 1)
                               ^
       error: type mismatch;
        found   : Throwable => Int
        required: PartialFunction[Throwable,?]

scala> Try[Int](???).recover { case _ => 1 }
res1: scala.util.Try[Int] = Success(1)
```

--

I've fixed that one, see [scala/scala#8172][] "Synthesize a PartialFunction from function literal"

[scala/scala#8172]: https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/8172

--

Coming in Scala 2.13.1

---

# Proposal

So, actually, I have 3 proposals.

---

# Proposal 1: The optimal solution

2 changes:

1. Make `Function1 extends PartialFunction`

--

2. Split `Function1`'s `apply` from `PartialFunction`'s `apply` (renamed `unsafeApply`)

--

```scala
trait PartialFunction[-A, +B] {
  def isDefinedAt(a: A): Boolean

  /** Call ONLY if `isDefinedAt` is `true` for `a`! */
  def unsafeApply(a: A): B

  def applyOrElse[A1 <: A, B1 >: B](a: A1, default: A1 => B1) =
    if (isDefinedAt(a)) unsafeApply(a) else default(a)
}

trait Function1[-A, +B] extends PartialFunction[A, B] {
  final def isDefinedAt(a: A) = true
  final def apply(a: A): B    = unsafeApply(a)
}
```

--

Note how `Function1` is still a SAM type.

???

With that implementation everything gets simpler

You can pass `Function1` values where `PartialFunction` values are expected

And the combinators (`andThen`, `orElse`, etc) are much simpler

---

# Proposal 1: The optimal solution

But the migration path is probably too complicate / not worth it.

--

My first idea was this:

1. introduce a new "partial function" as a super-type of `Function1`

--

2. eventually deprecate `PartialFunction` (and just lose the name "PartialFunction")

--

```scala
trait PF[-A, +B] { // real name, but with the ?=> alias
  def isDefinedAt(a: A): Boolean
  def unsafeApply(a: A): B

  def applyOrElse[A1 <: A, B1 >: B](a: A1, default: A1 => B1) =
    if (isDefinedAt(a)) unsafeApply(a) else default(a)
}

trait Function1[-A, +B] extends (A ?=> B) {
  final def isDefinedAt(a: A) = true
  final def unsafeApply(a: A) = apply(a)
}

trait PartialFunction[-A, +B] extends (A => B)
```

???

and then what?

In some version of Scala `{ case ... => ... }` generates a `PF` instead of `PartialFunction`?

:-/

---

# Proposal 2: The more likely solution

Just drop the inheritance:

--

```scala
trait PartialFunction[-A, +B] {
  def isDefinedAt(a: A): Boolean

  /** Call ONLY if `isDefinedAt` is `true` for `a`! */
  def unsafeApply(a: A): B

  @deprecated("Use unsafeApply", "3.0.0")
  def apply(a: A): B = unsafeApply(a)
}

trait Function1[-A, +B] {
  final def apply(a: A): B
}
```

???

So introduce `unsafeApply` on `PartialFunction`

and `@deprecate` `apply`

---

# Proposal 2: The more likely solution

Maybe add a converter to "upcast":

```scala
trait Function1[-A, +B] {
  ...
  def asPartial: A ?=>: B
}
```

--

```scala
Try[Int](???).recover(fallback.asPartial)
```

--

But you can also use eta-expansion:

```scala
Try[Int](???).recover(fallback(_))
```

--

Or you can just mix-in both traits (if you have many instances)

---

# Proposal 3: Or maybe...

The last idea is...

--

What if we actually had an unboxed `Option` in the standard library?

```scala
type Opt[+A] >: Opt.None.type <: AnyRef
```

--

Could we redefine `PartialFunction` with it and `Function1`?

```scala
type ?=>[-A, +B] = A => Opt[B]

given [A, B] (f: A ?=> B) {
  def andThen[C](g: B  => C): A ?=> C
  def andThen[C](g: B ?=> C): A ?=> C
  def compose[R](g: R ?=> A): R ?=> B
  def orElse[A1 <: A, B1 >: B](g: A1 ?=> B1): A1 ?=> B1
}
```

--

Maybe.

---

# Summary

1. Proposal 1: `Function1 extends PF`

--

2. Proposal 2: distinct `Function1` and `PartialFunction` types

--

3. Proposal 3: introduce `Opt` and compose with `Function1`

--

What do you prefer?
